Allows Envato authors to verify user purchases during registration

This plugin requires a API key and user account from the [Envato network](http://envato.com) 

It also adds an extra fields to the wp-login.php registration form two that allow users to enter their own passwords and one validates purchases using the Envato API. 

After registration users are automatically login in and redirected to the home page which can be filtered to redirect elsewhere.

This plugin currently has two shortcodes [cw-verifi-registration] which allows for user registration via the front-end and [cw-new-user]Hi new user![/cw-new-user] which allows to display a message to new users for the first 10 minutes they are logged in.
